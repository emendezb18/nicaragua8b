<p>This attraction was Discovered in 2004 by two Czech geologists, Somoto Canyon National has a Monument that is a protected gorge in northern Nicaragua and is about 2.5 hours from Leon.
    . You can book four- or six-hour descents of the narrowest section of the gorge. Both trips require rock scrambles, floating down rapids in inner tubes, and jumping from high cliffs into deep pools. The six-hour trip also includes rappelling down cliffs into bat-filled caves. Either way this is an adventurous day trip.
