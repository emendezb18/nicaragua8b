<h1>Revolution 1960</h1>
<p>The little Central American nation of Nicaragua underwent a protracted, decades-long revolution to free itself from both the oppressive Somoza regime and American imperialism. The Sandinista National Liberation Front FSLN was established in the early 1960s, but it didn't really pick up steam until the mid 1970s. The Sandinista rebels and the National Guard engaged in combat from 1978 to 1979, which culminated in the FSLN's successful toppling of the dictatorship. From 1979 to 1990, the Sandinistas held power; this is seen as the year the Revolution came to an end.

    <h1>Present day in Nicaragua</h1>
    <p>President Daniel Ortega's administration in Nicaragua has eliminated almost all institutional restraints on the exercise of presidential power since taking office in 2007. The Electoral Council, which is stacked with his allies, has banned opposition political parties and expelled opposition politicians. The Supreme Court of Justice has upheld electoral council rulings that violate political rights and enable Ortega to run for a second term despite a constitutional ban on reelection. With a 79 percent majority in congress in 2016, Ortega's Sandinista Party accelerated structural reforms that gave the president direct personal authority over the police and army, permitted him to legislate by decree, and let him to seek for reelection forever.
