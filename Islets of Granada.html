<p>In Nicaragua there are many lakes and in those lakes there are 365 small islands that are known as Islets of Granada they have like 25,000 years and they were formed from the ash and stones of the Mombacho volcano.
    Also in this little island you can see many nature and animals 
    The most known island is Jicaro Island.
    at Jicaro Island there's a two-story wooden tree houses that have an indoor/outdoor vibe and truly feel like sleeping in the midst of the jungle (but are protected from mosquitoes and other biting bugs). The reason of why people go there is because thereâ€™s many nature to see .
