    <p>Located atop the dormant Mombacho Volcano, this nature preserve includes a unique cloud forest landscape and covers 2,500 acres. It sits to the southwest of Managua, just 10 kilometers from the colonial town of Granada and magnificent Lake Nicaragua.
        Surrounded by rural farms and coffee plantations, the landscape is beautiful. The reserve is known for its prolific, colorful and fragrant flora, with more than 800 species of plants growing here.
        There are also hundreds of animal species making their home on Mombacho, including the bright red and green quetzal bird and a number of monkey species such as white-faced monkeys and howler monkeys. The best way to experience the preserve is on one of the many hiking trails running through it.
        The reserve is also home to a tourist center, where you can pick up a guide to hike around one of the four volcanic craters, all covered with a rare type of cloud forest that is only found in one other spot in Nicaragua: the Maderas volcano on Ometepe Island.
