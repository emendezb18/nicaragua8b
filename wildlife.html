<p>Nicaragua has a really diverse and extended wildlife, being next to Costa Rica it has a very similar flora and fauna. The Mot-Mot bird being their national animal The Mot Mot gets its name from the clock bird, whose disc-shaped tail feathers mimic a grandfather clock's pendulum. The fact that the bird is actually waving its tail back and forth, either as a means of communication with other mot mots or as a courtship ritual, just serves to emphasize how similar the two are.
