<p>In the southwest Nicaragua, on the Emerald Coast there’s San Juan del Sur, this is a little town with many people, and a very good surf beach that is just 20 miles to the north. The town is filled with many colorful buildings and murals. There’s also a part where you can see the sunset Alsp there are small hotels and eco-resorts. It picks up most of the swells that hit Nicaragua and is best approached at medium to high tide.

    The beach is also known for its long, drawn-out sunsets with an amazing display of bright, shifting colors.
