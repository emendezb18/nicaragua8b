<p>This lake is so big that when they discovered it they thought that it was a sea .Nicaragua Lake is Central America's largest lake at 177 kilometers long with an average width of 57 kilometers. It is home to more than 365 small islets and larger islands, like Ometepe, with two volcanos, in the lake's center.
    Another interesting fact about Lake Nicaragua is that it is the only freshwater lake to have ocean animals, including sharks. It is believed the lake was once a sea bay, but then a volcano erupted, trapping marine life and turning it into an inland lake. Over the millennia, marine life has adapted to living in freshwater.
