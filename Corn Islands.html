<p>In the Caribbean Sea, in Nicaragua there are the Corn Islands. 
    Some activities you can do is bike around it and you would take like 1 hour. Also in the corn island the beaches are beautiful. Another activity you can do is that From Big Corn you can go to the other island and you would take a 40-minute boat ride to Little Corn.  Little corn island has restaurants but no banks or vehicles. You can walk around Little Corn in less than an hour.
    And another activity that you could do is that there's excellent diving in the reefs off both the Corn Islands, so thatâ€™s the reason why many people visit.  </p>
